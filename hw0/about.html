			Hi! My name is Adam Pissaris and I am a sophomore at Yale University. I am a pround Walrus in Morse College, on my way to a degree in either Molecular Biology or Computer Science (or both). Outside of the classroom, I love to play sports. I am a midfielder for the Yale Club Soccer Team, but I also enjoy playing basketball and Ultimate frisbee in my free time. I am even training to become a sports-broadcaster for the Yale campus radio. When I'm off the field I like to teach and play video games. I am a DEMOS Math & Science tutor for lower schoolers and also a ReadySetLaunch Mentor for high school students working on their college applications. Finally, I work in a retinal physiology lab at the Yale Medical School.
